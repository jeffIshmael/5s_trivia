### Technology Stack
**React.js (with TypeScript):** For building dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
**Next.js 14.2.6:** Framework for server-side rendering and building scalable React applications.
**Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first CSS framework for styling components efficiently.
**Wagmi.js:** Library for interacting with Ethereum and other EVM-compatible blockchains.
**Sonner.js:** For managing in-app notifications.
**Open Trivia DB:** Source of trivia questions.

### LocalStorage API
LocalStorage has been used to keep track of user participation, ensuring users canâ€™t answer more than one quiz per day. Data is saved and retrieved using helper functions for serialization/deserialization.

### Wagmi.js
Wagmi is used to connect to the Ethereum network and interact with smart contracts. Functions like claimReward are executed via useContractWrite hooks from wagmi.

### Open Trivia DB
A public trivia API for fetching quiz questions. The app utilizes categories such as "General Knowledge," "Animals," "Vehicles," "History," and "Politics." which are passed randomly with every fetch request.
The API is called using a retry mechanism to handle rate-limiting errors.
